  "body": "#Spectral\r\n\r\nSpectral is an R package providing a new data type for R that stores spectral, temporal and spatial attributes of measurement data as well as methods for accessing and manipulating the spectral (and non-spectral) data. Once spectral data is imported into Spectral, the statistical and data processing power of R is available for various kinds of scientific analyses.\r\n\r\nIt provides the S4 classes: **_Spectra_** (stores spatial/temporal/spectral aspects of data), **_SpcHeader_** (stores metadata in an R list object) and **_SpcList_** (makes a collection of Spectra objects in an R list) as well as basic data access and manipulation methods for importing, acessing and subsetting, converting into R objects, analyzing, plotting and exporting scientific data.\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThe package is issued with a [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) license. Please consult the license documentation if you would like to use **Spectral** in your software projects.\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\n**Spectral** depends on the R packages *rgdal*, *spacetime* and *xlsx*. You need to install them before you can install **Spectral**. If you don't have them already, try :\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"rgdal\",\"spacetime\",\"xlsx\"),dep=T)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nFirst install the *devtools* package using *install.packages()* and then :\r\n```\r\nrequire(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"PranaGeo/Spectral\")\r\n```\r\n##Usage\r\nThe R code documentation is very incomplete. Sorry. After installing the package, you can try from the R prompt : ```?Spectral``` to consult the brief documentation of the package or ```?Spectra``` to  see the help of the constructor function the main class : *Spectra()*.\r\n\r\nYou can view the documentation [wiki](https://github.com/PranaGeo/Spectral/wiki) to learn how to use the package. \r\n\r\n##Contributions\r\nYour comments,suggestions and contributions are very welcome. Please feel free to open issues [here](https://github.com/PranaGeo/Spectral/issues).\r\n\r\n###Help the development\r\nIf you would like to contribute to the development, get a GitHub account, fork the *dev* branch of this project to your GitHub account, clone it to your local machine, work on it, commit your changes, push your changes to your GitHub fork and send us a pull request and we will discuss. For more information, visit the [fork & pull development model page.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull)\r\n",
